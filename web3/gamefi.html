    <h1 class="mb-4">GameFi</h1>
    <p>GameFi combines gaming with decentralized finance to create interactive experiences where players earn tokens or NFTs by participating in gameplay. Players can own, sell, and trade in-game assets, often represented as NFTs, across different platforms. Popular GameFi projects include Axie Infinity and Decentraland, where in-game economies mirror real-world markets. This play-to-earn model incentivizes engagement but also introduces economic risks, such as token price volatility and reliance on continuous user growth. As blockchain-based gaming evolves, GameFi aims to reshape traditional gaming by returning value to players.</p>
