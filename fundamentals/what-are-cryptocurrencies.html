  <h1 class="mb-4">What Are Cryptocurrencies?</h1>

  <p>Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (like the US dollar or Euro), cryptocurrencies are typically decentralized and operate on a blockchain‚Äîa distributed ledger enforced by a network of computers, called nodes.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">üí° Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Decentralized:</strong> Most cryptocurrencies operate without a central authority, using blockchain technology to maintain a shared ledger.</li>
    <li><strong>Secure:</strong> Transactions are verified by network participants (miners or validators) and recorded immutably.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> Public blockchains allow anyone to view transaction histories.</li>
    <li><strong>Global:</strong> Cryptocurrencies can be sent or received anywhere in the world, 24/7.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">üöÄ Examples of Popular Cryptocurrencies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bitcoin (BTC):</strong> The first and most widely used cryptocurrency, often seen as digital gold.</li>
    <li><strong>Ethereum (ETH):</strong> Enables smart contracts and decentralized applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Stablecoins:</strong> Such as USDC or USDT, pegged to real-world currencies for price stability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">üîç Why They Matter</h2>
  <p>Cryptocurrencies power the Web3 ecosystem. They are essential for interacting with decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming platforms, and decentralized apps (dApps).</p>
  <p>Beyond investment, cryptocurrencies enable new models for ownership, governance, and access in digital environments.</p>
