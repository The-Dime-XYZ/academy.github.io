  <h1 class="mb-4">Introduction to DeFi</h1>

  <p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) refers to a new financial system built on public blockchains like Ethereum, aiming to eliminate the need for traditional financial intermediaries such as banks and brokers.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🔍 What Makes DeFi Unique?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Trustless:</strong> Transactions are verified through smart contracts instead of relying on third parties.</li>
    <li><strong>Open and Inclusive:</strong> Anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet can participate.</li>
    <li><strong>Programmable:</strong> Developers can build custom logic into financial tools using smart contracts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">📊 Core DeFi Use Cases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lending & Borrowing:</strong> Platforms like Aave and Compound let users lend their crypto to earn interest or borrow against it.</li>
    <li><strong>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs):</strong> Like Uniswap, where users trade directly from their wallets.</li>
    <li><strong>Stablecoins:</strong> Pegged to fiat currencies, these are essential for reducing volatility.</li>
    <li><strong>Yield Farming:</strong> Users move assets between protocols to earn returns.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">⚠️ Risks and Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Smart Contract Bugs:</strong> Code vulnerabilities can be exploited.</li>
    <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Crypto asset prices can change rapidly.</li>
    <li><strong>Impermanent Loss:</strong> A risk in liquidity pools when token values diverge.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>DeFi represents the cutting edge of finance—transparent, permissionless, and decentralized—but it also requires due diligence and caution when participating.</p>
