  <h1 class="mb-4">How Blockchain Works</h1>
  <p>Blockchain is the foundational technology behind cryptocurrencies and Web3. It is a distributed digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant way.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🧱 What is a Block?</h2>
  <p>A <strong>block</strong> is a collection of data—usually transaction records. Each block contains:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A list of transactions</li>
    <li>A timestamp</li>
    <li>A reference (hash) to the previous block</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Blocks are linked together in chronological order to form a <strong>chain</strong>—hence, the name "blockchain."</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🔗 How Blocks are Added</h2>
  <p>New blocks are added to the blockchain through a process called <strong>consensus</strong>, where participants in the network agree on the validity of transactions. Two common methods are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Proof of Work (PoW):</strong> Computers solve complex puzzles to validate transactions. This is used in Bitcoin.</li>
    <li><strong>Proof of Stake (PoS):</strong> Validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to “stake.” Used in Ethereum 2.0 and other chains.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🛡 Why It's Secure</h2>
  <p>Blockchains are considered secure because:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each block contains the hash of the previous block—if one is altered, the chain breaks.</li>
    <li>The ledger is distributed—no single point of failure or control.</li>
    <li>Consensus rules prevent invalid transactions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🌐 Real-World Applications</h2>
  <p>Besides powering cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, blockchain is used in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Supply chain tracking</li>
    <li>Voting systems</li>
    <li>Digital identity</li>
    <li>Decentralized finance (DeFi)</li>
  </ul>
