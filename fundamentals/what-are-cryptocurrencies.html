  <h1 class="mb-4">What Are Cryptocurrencies?</h1>

  <p>Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual assets that use cryptographic techniques to secure transactions, control the creation of new units, and verify transfers of ownership. Unlike traditional currencies issued and regulated by central banks, cryptocurrencies are typically decentralized and operate on public blockchains‚Äîdistributed ledgers maintained by a global network of computers, known as nodes.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">üí° Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Decentralized:</strong> Operate independently of central banks or governments, providing users with direct control over their funds.</li>
    <li><strong>Secure:</strong> Utilize advanced cryptography and consensus algorithms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake to ensure trust and data integrity.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> Transactions are recorded on public ledgers accessible to anyone, improving auditability and reducing fraud.</li>
    <li><strong>Borderless & 24/7:</strong> Can be sent or received globally without reliance on traditional banking hours or intermediaries.</li>
    <li><strong>Finite Supply:</strong> Many cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have a capped supply, making them resistant to inflationary monetary policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">üöÄ Examples of Popular Cryptocurrencies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bitcoin (BTC):</strong> The original cryptocurrency, often considered digital gold, primarily used as a store of value and hedge against inflation.</li>
    <li><strong>Ethereum (ETH):</strong> A platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts, enabling innovations in DeFi, NFTs, and more.</li>
    <li><strong>Stablecoins:</strong> Cryptocurrencies like USDC and USDT that are pegged to fiat currencies, offering price stability for everyday use and trading.</li>
    <li><strong>Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and others:</strong> Compete to offer fast, scalable blockchain infrastructures for decentralized applications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">üîç Why They Matter</h2>
  <p>Cryptocurrencies are at the heart of the evolving Web3 ecosystem. They provide the economic layer for decentralized applications (dApps), enable user ownership of digital assets, and allow permissionless participation in financial systems.</p>
  <p>From enabling peer-to-peer payments and remittances to powering decentralized exchanges and yield farming strategies, cryptocurrencies represent a fundamental shift in how value is transferred, stored, and governed on the internet.</p>
  <p>Moreover, they are catalyzing innovations in areas like digital identity, global fundraising (via token sales), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and community-owned networks.</p>
