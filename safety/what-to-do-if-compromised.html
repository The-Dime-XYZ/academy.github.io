  <h1 class="mb-4">What to Do If Your Wallet Is Compromised</h1>

  <p>Discovering that your crypto wallet has been compromised can be alarming, but taking swift and informed action can minimize the damage. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to respond if your wallet or associated accounts have been breached:</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🚨 1. Act Quickly – Move Your Funds</h2>
  <p>If you still have access to your wallet, immediately transfer any remaining assets to a secure address—preferably a new wallet with freshly generated keys or a trusted cold wallet. Time is critical to prevent additional losses.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🔍 2. Revoke Suspicious Token Approvals</h2>
  <p>Use tools like <a href="https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker" target="_blank">Etherscan Token Approval Checker</a> or <a href="https://revoke.cash/" target="_blank">Revoke.cash</a> to remove token approvals you've granted to smart contracts. Some exploits rely on having permission to move your tokens.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🔐 3. Secure Your Associated Accounts</h2>
  <p>Change passwords for your email, crypto exchanges, and social accounts immediately. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible. If you use a password manager, update your master password too.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🔎 4. Identify the Breach</h2>
  <p>Try to determine how your security was compromised:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Did you click on a suspicious link or connect your wallet to an unknown site?</li>
    <li>Was your device infected with malware?</li>
    <li>Was your seed phrase stored insecurely or leaked?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Understanding the cause helps you prevent repeat incidents.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">📣 5. Report the Incident</h2>
  <p>Notify the platform or service involved (e.g., an NFT marketplace, DeFi app, or wallet provider) if applicable. Also consider reporting the wallet address to blockchain explorers as compromised.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🛡 6. Educate and Rebuild</h2>
  <p>Once you've contained the breach, review your security practices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use hardware wallets for long-term storage</li>
    <li>Store seed phrases offline and never digitally</li>
    <li>Regularly audit wallet connections and revoke permissions</li>
    <li>Avoid clicking on unsolicited DMs or email links</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Recovering from a breach can be difficult, but it's a valuable reminder of how critical good security hygiene is in Web3.</p>
