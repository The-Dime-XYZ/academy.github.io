  <h1 class="mb-4">Introduction to Bitcoin</h1>

  <p>Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency, launched in 2009 by an unknown individual or group using the pseudonym <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong>. It introduced a revolutionary form of peer-to-peer value exchange that eliminates the need for banks or intermediaries.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">üîó Why Bitcoin Matters</h2>
  <p>Bitcoin was created as a response to the 2008 financial crisis. It offers an alternative to traditional financial systems by giving individuals full control over their money. Its core features include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> No central authority controls Bitcoin; it's maintained by a global network of nodes.</li>
    <li><strong>Limited Supply:</strong> Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist, making it deflationary.</li>
    <li><strong>Borderless:</strong> Can be sent or received anywhere, anytime.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> All transactions are recorded on a public blockchain.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">‚öôÔ∏è How It Works</h2>
  <p>Bitcoin transactions are verified and added to the blockchain by miners using a process called <strong>Proof of Work (PoW)</strong>. This makes the network secure and resistant to fraud.</p>
  <p>Users store their Bitcoin in digital wallets, which allow them to send, receive, and manage their assets.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">üí° Use Cases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Digital store of value (often called "digital gold")</li>
    <li>Medium of exchange in peer-to-peer payments</li>
    <li>Tool for financial sovereignty in regions with unstable currencies</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As the first successful implementation of blockchain technology, Bitcoin laid the foundation for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>
