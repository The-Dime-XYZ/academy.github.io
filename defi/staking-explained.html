  <h1 class="mb-4">Staking Explained</h1>

  <p>Staking is a key feature of many proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain networks. It allows users to earn rewards by helping to secure the network and validate transactions.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🔐 What Is Staking?</h2>
  <p>When you stake your cryptocurrency, you're locking it into the blockchain network. In return, the network uses your funds to support operations such as block validation. You earn rewards—usually in the form of additional tokens—for contributing to network security.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🏦 Why Stake?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Earn passive income:</strong> Your staked tokens generate periodic rewards.</li>
    <li><strong>Support decentralization:</strong> You’re helping maintain the integrity and reliability of the network.</li>
    <li><strong>Low effort:</strong> Especially if using centralized platforms or liquid staking protocols.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">💡 Staking Methods</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Direct staking:</strong> Run a validator node (technical).</li>
    <li><strong>Delegated staking:</strong> Stake via an existing validator (user-friendly).</li>
    <li><strong>Centralized staking:</strong> Use platforms like Binance, Kraken, or Coinbase.</li>
    <li><strong>Liquid staking:</strong> Retain liquidity using tokens like stETH or mSOL while earning staking rewards.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">⚠️ Risks to Consider</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Slashing:</strong> Penalties if validators misbehave or go offline.</li>
    <li><strong>Lock-up periods:</strong> Tokens may be inaccessible during staking.</li>
    <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Token price may drop while staked.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Staking is a fundamental part of modern blockchains and a great way to earn yield while contributing to network security—just make sure to understand the risks involved.</p>
