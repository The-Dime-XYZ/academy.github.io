  <h1 class="mb-4">Guide to Web3</h1>

  <p>Web3 represents the next evolution of the internet, where users have greater control over their data, identity, and interactions. Unlike Web1 (static web pages) and Web2 (interactive, but centralized platforms), Web3 uses blockchain and decentralized technologies to build a trustless, permissionless internet.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🌐 Key Characteristics of Web3</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> No single entity controls the network. Instead, data is stored on blockchains and peer-to-peer networks.</li>
    <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> Users truly own their digital assets, identities, and data.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Open-source code and publicly accessible ledgers enhance trust and auditability.</li>
    <li><strong>Incentives:</strong> Token economies reward users, creators, and developers directly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">⚙️ Core Components</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> The foundational technology that ensures security and transparency.</li>
    <li><strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Self-executing code that defines logic behind apps, finance, and governance.</li>
    <li><strong>dApps (Decentralized Apps):</strong> Applications built on blockchains, not reliant on centralized servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Wallets:</strong> Your key to managing identities, signing transactions, and holding digital assets.</li>
    <li><strong>Tokens:</strong> Representing everything from governance power to in-game items and stablecoins.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🔐 Benefits for Users</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Control over data and digital presence</li>
    <li>New income and participation opportunities (e.g., airdrops, staking, DAOs)</li>
    <li>Global accessibility and censorship resistance</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">📌 Real-World Use Cases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Finance:</strong> DeFi platforms enabling loans, exchanges, and yield without banks</li>
    <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> Play-to-earn ecosystems with real economic incentives</li>
    <li><strong>Social:</strong> Decentralized social media with creator-owned content and tokens</li>
    <li><strong>Identity:</strong> Self-sovereign identities and verifiable credentials</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Web3 is still evolving, but it represents a radical shift in how the internet operates—toward openness, inclusion, and empowerment. As you learn more, you’ll begin to recognize how these technologies are reshaping the digital world around you.</p>
