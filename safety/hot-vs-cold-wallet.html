  <p>When it comes to storing your cryptocurrency, choosing the right type of wallet is crucial for security and convenience. Wallets fall into two main categories: hot wallets and cold wallets. Each serves a different purpose and comes with its own advantages and trade-offs.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">üî• What is a Hot Wallet?</h2>
  <p>A hot wallet is any cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the internet. This includes mobile wallets, desktop apps, and browser extensions. Hot wallets are commonly used for day-to-day transactions and quick access to funds.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom</li>
    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to set up and use; convenient for frequent trading or payments</li>
    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> More vulnerable to hacks, malware, and phishing attacks due to internet exposure</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">‚ùÑÔ∏è What is a Cold Wallet?</h2>
  <p>A cold wallet stores your private keys offline, meaning it‚Äôs not connected to the internet. This makes it much harder for attackers to steal your crypto. Cold wallets are ideal for long-term storage and holding large balances.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor, or even paper wallets</li>
    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Superior security; immune to online attacks when not connected</li>
    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Less convenient for daily use; requires extra steps to move or access funds</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">üí° Best Practices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a hot wallet for small amounts and daily transactions</li>
    <li>Store large holdings in a cold wallet, preferably a hardware device</li>
    <li>Always back up your recovery phrases and never share your private keys</li>
    <li>Keep your software wallets and devices updated</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Understanding the difference between hot and cold wallets helps you make better decisions about how to manage your crypto assets securely. Many experienced users combine both types for convenience and safety.</p>
