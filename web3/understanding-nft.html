  <h1 class="mb-4">Understanding NFTs</h1>

  <p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a type of digital asset that represent ownership or proof of authenticity for a unique item or piece of content on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum‚Äîwhich are fungible, meaning each unit is the same‚ÄîNFTs are distinct and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">üßæ What Makes NFTs Unique?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Each NFT carries information that distinguishes it from other tokens. This might include a name, description, and link to digital files like images or videos.</li>
    <li><strong>Provenance:</strong> Blockchain technology allows every NFT‚Äôs creation, ownership, and transaction history to be publicly verified.</li>
    <li><strong>Scarcity:</strong> Creators can issue limited editions or 1-of-1 NFTs, making them rare and collectible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">üé® Popular Use Cases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Digital Art:</strong> Artists mint works as NFTs to sell and track ownership online.</li>
    <li><strong>Collectibles:</strong> Trading cards, avatars, or in-game items tied to a specific NFT.</li>
    <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> Players own unique weapons, outfits, or characters that can be used or traded across platforms.</li>
    <li><strong>Music and Media:</strong> Musicians and creators sell rights or experiences through NFTs.</li>
    <li><strong>Event Tickets:</strong> NFTs can serve as entry passes with anti-fraud and resale control features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">üì¶ Standards and Platforms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ERC-721:</strong> The original standard for NFTs on Ethereum.</li>
    <li><strong>ERC-1155:</strong> A more flexible standard supporting both fungible and non-fungible tokens.</li>
    <li><strong>Marketplaces:</strong> OpenSea, Blur, Rarible, Magic Eden, and LooksRare are popular platforms to trade NFTs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations Before Buying</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Do your research:</strong> Who is the creator? Is there a community or roadmap?</li>
    <li><strong>Gas fees:</strong> Blockchain networks charge fees for minting or transferring NFTs.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Keep your NFTs in a secure wallet‚Äîhardware wallets are recommended for valuable assets.</li>
    <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> NFTs are harder to sell quickly than regular crypto tokens.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>NFTs offer a powerful way to represent digital ownership and creativity. As the space evolves, new use cases and innovations continue to emerge. Whether you're a collector, artist, or investor, understanding the basics of NFTs is a great starting point.</p>
