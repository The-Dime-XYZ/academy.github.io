  <h1 class="mb-4">Centralised and Decentralised Exchanges</h1>

  <p>Cryptocurrency exchanges are platforms where users buy, sell, and trade digital assets. There are two primary types: centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🏛 Centralised Exchanges (CEXs)</h2>
  <p>CEXs are operated by companies that provide trading infrastructure, manage order books, and hold custody of users’ assets. Examples include Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> High liquidity, fast transaction speeds, user-friendly interfaces, fiat support.</li>
    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires trust in the platform, custodial risks, potential for government regulation or censorship.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🌐 Decentralised Exchanges (DEXs)</h2>
  <p>DEXs operate using smart contracts on blockchains. Users retain control of their private keys and trade peer-to-peer. Popular DEXs include Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and SushiSwap.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Non-custodial, censorship-resistant, greater privacy.</li>
    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> May have lower liquidity, higher fees during congestion, and steeper learning curve.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🤔 Which One Should You Use?</h2>
  <p>If you're a beginner, CEXs offer a more familiar experience similar to online banking. If you value privacy and control, DEXs offer a more decentralized approach.</p>
