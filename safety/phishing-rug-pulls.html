  <h1 class="mb-4">Phishing & Rug Pulls</h1>

  <p>As exciting as the world of crypto can be, it’s also full of scams. Two of the most common—and most dangerous—are phishing attacks and rug pulls. Understanding how they work is essential to protecting your digital assets.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">🎣 What is Phishing?</h2>
  <p>Phishing is a social engineering tactic where attackers pose as legitimate entities to trick you into revealing sensitive information like your seed phrase or private keys.</p>

  <h3 class="mt-4">🛠 Common Tactics:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fake Websites:</strong> Cloned versions of popular wallet apps or DApps with nearly identical URLs.</li>
    <li><strong>Phishing Emails:</strong> Messages urging you to “verify your account” or “recover lost funds.”</li>
    <li><strong>Impersonation:</strong> Scammers pretending to be support staff in Discord, Telegram, or Twitter.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>How to Protect Yourself:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Never share your seed phrase or private key—no legitimate service will ask for it.</li>
    <li>Double-check website URLs before connecting your wallet.</li>
    <li>Use bookmarks for frequently used sites to avoid typo-squatting domains.</li>
    <li>Install anti-phishing browser extensions if available.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">💣 What is a Rug Pull?</h2>
  <p>A rug pull is a type of exit scam where developers abandon a crypto project after collecting funds, often taking users’ liquidity with them.</p>

  <h3 class="mt-4">🔍 Common Signs of a Rug Pull:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Anonymous Team:</strong> No identifiable team members or fake LinkedIn profiles.</li>
    <li><strong>Sudden Token Launches:</strong> Little to no information, rushed timelines, and no audits.</li>
    <li><strong>Honeypot Contracts:</strong> Smart contracts that allow buying but block selling.</li>
    <li><strong>Overpromising:</strong> Unrealistic returns or partnerships that don’t exist.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>How to Stay Safe:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Always DYOR (Do Your Own Research).</li>
    <li>Verify if the code is audited and available publicly.</li>
    <li>Look for active and transparent communities on Discord and Twitter.</li>
    <li>Start with small investments and avoid FOMO-driven decisions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By learning to recognize the red flags and taking proper precautions, you can significantly reduce your exposure to scams and protect your crypto journey.</p>
